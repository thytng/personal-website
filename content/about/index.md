Hello and welcome! My name is Thy Nguyen (she/her) and I am a senior Applied Mathematics and Statistics major at Macalester College. I am primarily interested in the field of data science but I have also dabbled in software engineering. My love language is R and I have a decent command of Python, Java, SQL, and ArcGIS. I have worked as a research assistant for two proprietary projects led by Macalester professors, detecting and correcting inaccurate latitudinal and longitudinal data entries in summer 2018 and modeling college rankings after U.S. News & World Report's system and methodology in summer 2020. I was a TA for the introductory computer science and data science classes offered by my school and since spring 2019, I have led a team of TAs for the introductory Java and object-oriented programming course. Offline, I like to read, knit, run, and listen to true crime.
